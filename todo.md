## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components)
- Implement proper error handling in all API calls
- Add proper loading states for all async operations
- Use the existing Zustand patterns for state management

### Performance Considerations

- Implement proper memoization for expensive computations
- Use React.memo for components that don't need frequent re-renders
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Use virtualization for large lists (messages, members)
- Implement proper image optimization and lazy loading

### Security Practices

- Never store sensitive data in localStorage without encryption
- Validate all user inputs before API calls
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Use secure WebSocket connections in production
- Follow secure coding practices for file uploads

### Testing Strategy

- Write tests for all API integration functions
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Implement proper mocking for external dependencies
- Add integration tests for critical user flows
- Test real-time features with multiple concurrent users

## Priority Notes

**Highest Priority (Must Complete First):**

- Phase 1 (Authentication) - Required for all other phases
- Phase 2 (Workspace/Channels) - Core functionality
- Phase 3 (Real-time Messaging) - Primary feature

**Medium Priority:**

- Phase 4 (File Uploads) - Enhances messaging
- Phase 5 (Direct Messages) - Important for collaboration
- Phase 6 (Task Management) - Productivity features

**Nice to Have:**

- Phase 7 (Advanced Features) - Polish and UX improvements
- Phase 8 (Testing/Deployment) - Production readiness

This roadmap ensures systematic development of the Collabix application, building from core authentication to advanced collaboration features while maintaining code quality and performance standards.
